# Questions:

## 1
Two Sum : Check if a pair with given sum exists in Array

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## 2
Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

Problem Statement: Given an array nums consisting of only 0, 1, or 2. Sort the array in non-decreasing order. The sorting must be done in-place, without making a copy of the original array.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
<pre>
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

</pre>

## 3
Majority Element

Problem Statement: Given an integer array nums of size n, return the majority element of the array.

The majority element of an array is an element that appears more than n/2 times in the array. The array is guaranteed to have a majority element.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
</pre>

# 4
Maximum Subarray

Problem Statement: Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum and return the sum of the elements present in that subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

> **KADANE'S ALGORITHM**

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

>**Kadane's Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array**

Problem Statement: Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum and return the sum of the elements present in that subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input:
 nums = [2, 3, 5, -2, 7, -4]  
Output:
 15  
Explanation:
 The subarray from index 0 to index 4 has the largest sum = 15, which is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

Example 2:
Input:
 nums = [-2, -3, -7, -2, -10, -4]  
Output:
 -2  
Explanation:
 The largest sum is -2, which comes from taking the element at index 0 or index 3 as the subarray. Since all numbers are negative, the subarray with the least negative number gives the largest sum.

# 6

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

# 7

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should return the array of nums such that the array follows the given conditions:

1. Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.

2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.

3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

*Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.*

<pre>
<b>Example 1:</b>
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  

<b>Example 2:
</b>
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
</pre>

**Constraints:**
- 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
- nums.length is even
- 1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105
- nums consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.

# 8

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

<br>

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
- Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
- While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
 
</pre>

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100

## 9
You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input:
 arr = [4, 7, 1, 0]  
Output:
 7 1 0  
Explanation:
 The rightmost element (0) is always a leader.  
7 and 1 are greater than the elements to their right, making them leaders as well.

Example 2:
Input:
 arr = [10, 22, 12, 3, 0, 6]  
Output:
 22 12 6  
Explanation:
 6 is a leader because there are no elements after it.  
12 is greater than all the elements to its right (3, 0, 6), and 22 is greater than 12, 3, 0, 6, making them leaders as well.
</pre>

## 10
Problem Statement: Given an array nums of n integers.

Return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input:
 nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]  
Output:
 4  
Explanation:
 The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

Example 2:
Input:
 nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output:
 9  
Explanation:
 The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has a length of 9.

## 12
**Rotate Image**

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
