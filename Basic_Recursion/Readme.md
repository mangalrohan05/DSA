</pre>

## Q6
Factorial of a Number : Iterative and Recursive

Problem Statement: Given a number X,  print its factorial.

To obtain the factorial of a number, it has to be multiplied by all the whole numbers preceding it. More precisely X! = X*(X-1)*(X-2) … 1.

Note: X  is always a positive number. 
<pre>
Example 1:
Input: X = 5
Output: 120
Explanation: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1

Example 2:
Input: X = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 3!=3*2*1
</pre>

## Q7
Reverse a given Array

Problem Statement: You are given an array. The task is to reverse the array and print it. 
<pre>
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5}
Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.

Example 2:
Input: N=6 arr[] = {10,20,30,40}
Output: {40,30,20,10}
Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.
</pre>

## Q8
Check if the given String is Palindrome or not

Problem Statement: "Given a string, check if the string is palindrome or not."  A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string.
<pre>
Example 1:
Input: Str =  “ABCDCBA”
Output: Palindrome
Explanation: String when reversed is the same as string.

Example 2:
Input: Str = “TAKE U FORWARD”
Output: Not Palindrome
Explanation: String when reversed is not the same as string.
</pre>

## Q9

Input: N = 5
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5
Explanation: 0 1 1 2 3 5 is the fibonacci series up to 5th term.(0 based indexing)

Example 2:
Input: 6

Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
Explanation: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 is the fibonacci series upto 6th term.(o based indexing)
