# Questions:

## Q1
> Count frequency of each element in the array

Problem statement: Given an array, we have found the number of occurrences of each element in the array.

<pre>
Examples:

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = {10,5,10,15,10,5};
Output: 10  3
	 5  2
        15  1
Explanation: 10 occurs 3 times in the array
	      5 occurs 2 times in the array
              15 occurs 1 time in the array

Example2: 
Input: arr[] = {2,2,3,4,4,2};
Output: 2  3
	3  1
        4  2
Explanation: 2 occurs 3 times in the array
	     3 occurs 1 time in the array
             4 occurs 2 time in the array
</pre>

## Q2
> Find the highest/lowest frequency element

Problem Statement: Problem Statement: Given an array of size N. Find the highest and lowest frequency element.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input: array[] = {10,5,10,15,10,5};
Output: 10 15
Explanation: The frequency of 10 is 3, i.e. the highest and the frequency of 15 is 1 i.e. the lowest.


Example 2:
Input: array[] = {2,2,3,4,4,2};
Output: 2 3
Explanation: The frequency of 2 is 3, i.e. the highest and the frequency of 3 is 1 i.e. the lowest.
